# SCSS Demo

This repository contains a demonstration of using SCSS (Sassy CSS) to style HTML documents. It includes examples of various SCSS features such as variables, mixins, nesting, and imports.

## Project Structure

- `css/`: Contains the compiled CSS files and the SCSS source files.
  - `reset.css` and `reset.scss`: CSS reset files to remove default browser styling.
  - `sass-demo1.css` and `sass-demo1.scss`: Demonstrates the use of variables and basic styling.
  - `sass-demo2.css` and `sass-demo2.scss`: Demonstrates nesting in SCSS.
  - `sass-demo3.css` and `sass-demo3.scss`: Demonstrates mixins and includes.
  - `sass-demo4.css` and `sass-demo4.scss`: Demonstrates the use of imports in SCSS.
- HTML files (`sass-demo1.html`, `sass-demo2.html`, `sass-demo3.html`, `sass-demo4.html`): HTML documents that link to the corresponding CSS files to showcase the styling.
